# Alexa Boilerplate

Quickly get started developing Amazon Alexa skills for you Amazon Echo.  After a few short setup steps you will be able to create a functioning skill and deploy it to Amazon Lambda.  The boilerplate app includes two of the best npm modules for creating Alexa skills: [alexa-app](https://github.com/matt-kruse/alexa-app) for providing structure to you application, and [grunt-aws-lambda](https://github.com/Tim-B/grunt-aws-lambda) for uploading your code to Amazon Lambda from the command line by simply typing `grunt deploy`.


## Setup

Configuring the sample app is as easy as pasting the ARN of your Lambda function into `config/default.json` and running `npm install`. That's it! If you don't know how to get your ARN then read "Creating you Lambda function" below.

```
{
	"Amazon" : {
		"lambda-arn" : "YOUR ARN HERE",
	}
}
```

## Deploying to Amazon Lambda

`grunt` makes it easy to deploy code. Just run:

```
grunt deploy
```

## The Sample Project

Check out `index.js` for the boilerplate Alexa app. Examples of how to define an intent handler, build sample utterences and schema, and response asynchronously are all included. 

## Creating you Lambda function

Each Alexa skill requires a Lambda function. 

1. Log into the [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions) and making sure your region is set to `us-east-1`
2. Click "Create Lambda Function"
3. Choose to skip the "Select blueprint" phase
4. Give your function a name and description. For the inital code, just type `{}` which is valid Javascript that does nothing. We will be uploading our code via `grunt` later.
5. Set the role and create your function.
6. Copy the ARN from the top right corner of the function page.
